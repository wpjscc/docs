 * A documentation is a singular collection of documentation content. This can be used to document systems, plugins,

 * and can be either sourced locally, or from a remote location as a ZIP archive.
 *
 * The Documentation class is a manager for this collection of documentation. It handles the retrieval and processing
 * of the documentation, and provides a Page List of the contents.
